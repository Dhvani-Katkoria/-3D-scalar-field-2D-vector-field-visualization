# 3D-scalar-field-2D-vector-field-visualization
3D scalar field/2D vector field visualization for the data set of simulation of a hurricane from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the United States.

The dataset is available at http://sciviscontest-staging.ieeevis.org/2004/data.html

The visualizations demonstrate slicing and isosurface extraction in the volumetric data for 3 different scalar fields, and show their changes over time using the same 5 different time instances.

The time instances for which visualizations are generated are selected based on box plots.

2D vector field visualization demonstrate streamlines of 2D wind speed field (in u,v directions) in sea surface
changing over 5 different time instances.
